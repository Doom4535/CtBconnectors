Assorted collection of cable to breadboard breakout schematics

This is a random grouping of breakout boards for some common cable types.
It was inspired by my need for a ribbon cable to breadboard adapter and has
since grown to include a variety of different connectors.

Included connectors: <br />
  * SATA power <br />
  * SATA Data <br />
  * 8x ribbon <br />
  * 10x ribbon <br />
  * 16x ribbon <br />
  * 20x ribbon <br />
  * 40x ribbon <br />
  * 46x ribbon <br />
  * RJ11 (Phone jack) <br />
  * RJ45 (Ethernet jack) <br />
  
Currently, all the modules are in a single project file.  I may or may not split
them out into their own independent batch of gerber files (for easier custom panelization).
The current grouping was chosen to speed up layout and because I use low cost fab houses
(such as DirtyPCB, OshPark, and Elecrow) that send you 'x' number of PCB's with each order,
and I would like to have a variety of connectors (hence the 'variety' pack).
